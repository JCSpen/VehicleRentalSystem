A small application that simulates how a Vehicle Rental System might work. Complete with an SQL back-end database, the user can create new accounts, add and remove vehicles, and interact with them accordingly. If you check my other repositories, there is an incomplete project named "RentalSystem", which was my first attempt at creating said system. It was abandonded, midway through development, as a much more efficient and robust approach to this problem was uncovered, and following an error when attempting to push said repository, I decided to create a new repositry from that point, and utilise my new approach.
